<!--  To my peer graders:
      The guidelines say that we can put whatever text we want in the sections
      and titles.  I know that the mockup depicts a menu but given that we
      can put any text content we want, I decided to do something a little bit
      different for this project (I fully expect to have to do an actual menu
      on the next project and will have to start from scratch but that just
      means more practice for me).  Instead of filling the content with dummy
      text, I put in photos of my dogs with descriptions of each of them.

      I'm hoping you won't ding me for this.  I'm still using unique colors and
      following all of the responsive layout guidelines.  I just wanted to practice
      with more interesting content elements than just text.  Plus they are some
      darn cute dogs.

      Thanks,
      Your fellow learner.

          <p>Maple Sugar is the oldest.  She is introverted but friendly toward people.  She can be a little bit snippy with other dogs who invade her personal space and is protective of her pack.  She is also very mannerly and respectful.  I call her "The Goodest Girl".

          <img src="images/Oakie.jpeg">
          <p>Oakie is the "middle child".  She is very affectionate but neurotic.  She barks at strangers (and neighbors, and sometimes at inanimate objects that worry her) but switches to wags and licks if they ignore her scary posturing and greet her with happy sounds.  Oakie isn't as keen to follow rules as Maple but she groans with happiness whenever she is made over.  She also has panic attacks whenever anybody sneezes.</p>

          <img src="images/Caboose.jpeg">
          <p>Caboose is the youngest and the only male.  He is happy-go-lucky and thinks everyone is his best friend.  He is extremely bull-headed and doesn't tend to be in tune with what people around him want and will single-mindedly pursue whatever goal his attention is currently fixated on.  He loves attention and often pushes Oakie out of the way if she is getting pets.  He loves to cuddle.</p>
